Welcome to Derp Boi!

You play as Derp, an unfortunate astronaut who is not a great pilot.
After crash landing in front of a mysterious cave, Derp decides
to go spelunking. Using a mysterious weapon you find, survive the
challenges found in the cave, and make it to the other side!

The mysterious Portal gun creates twin portals, one blue and one orange.

        - Used parts of tutorials 3, 4 and 6 to create a player, build objects, and the background of the level
        - Player code was changed significantly to remove the flying feature as well as to incorporate gun mechanics
